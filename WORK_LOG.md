First, as I was trying to run the BlickCompressor in the terminal, I needed to cd into src first before I do anything. Second, I tried to figure what was going on in the BlickCompressor (like what were the 2 functions doing). Afterwards, I wrote some code which does compress and expand the genome test. However, I need to check if it works and if I hit the compression ratio of less than 30%. |
| November 13 |  1:00 - 1:45  | Created a map where the index is the letter and the value is the binary code assigned to each letter. These codes are 2 bits. Additionally, added meta data to the file by adding an integer at the beginning saying how many codes are in the file in total (part of the theory in class). This is all part of the compression functions which is now completed. Additionally, I started working on expand. I created a map in which the index is the binary code and the value is the letter assigned to the code. Additionally, I would get the int meta data at the beginning of the file and create a for loop using the int as the length. Now I just need to test if it works. |

Observed no difference between the original file and the new file we get from the expand method. Additionally, checked the compression ratio and saw that it is around 40%. I am not sure why it isn't 25% like it says in the slides. I made sure to use an int and use 2 bit codes so I am not sure. Ultimately, my functions do work. |
